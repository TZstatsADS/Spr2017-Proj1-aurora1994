### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Tense Analysis in Inaugural Speech
+ This project is conducted by [Jingwen Yin]

+ Project summary: In this project, I did simple tense analysis to see how presidents structure their inaugural speech, what percent of their speeches referred to present/past/future, and how the tense of sentences change throughout their speech. I also combined tense and sentiment analysis to see presidents' emotions when they referred to different time and when they talked about the past in different terms.
